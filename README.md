**Students Control**

Copy of collaborative project from gitlab.ccfit.nsu.ru . Darya Usova and Daniil Zulin worked on a project.

The main goal of our project is to help teachers to keep track of students attendance. Camera registers students and notes which students have come by the beginning of the lesson. Then, attendance information traffic information goes to the server. Server can store atteddance and give information about student attendace to the front page.
